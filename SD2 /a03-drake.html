            <p style="text-align:center;"> My Name is Collin Drake and im a sophomore at Marist college. 
                I study Computer Science and am interested in a double major next fall regarding cybersecurity.
                Coding is something I just picked up in college and im motivated and disciplined to become the best programmer I can be.
                On campus I am apart of the marist mens club soccer team, the computer society and I take part in intramural sports.
                Off campus I like to learn and practice MMA fighting, invest in crypto currency and exercise consistently.
                A few other things you should know about me are that I like music, drawing and learning new things!
                You'll always catch me studying or exercising.  To learn more about me and my interests dive into this page!</p>
