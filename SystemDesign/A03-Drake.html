                    A conceptual model was defined by Jeff Johnson and Austin henderson but 
                    according to the book a more reasonable definition is a description outlining how people can use a product and the concepts people use to interact with it.
                    It is a strategy or manual to the concepts of a tool or product.
                    The characteristics of the best ones are metaphors to show people how to understand a product and how to use it, 
                    how they are exposed to the product and the relationships between concepts and products.

                    Paperback book vs Ebook
                    <ul>
                        <li>  -an ebook is easier to obtain and use, and most of the time is cheaper.  You can even get a computer to read it to you.  The only draw back is you may not retain the material as much and it takes up space on your device.</li>
                        <li>  - a paperback book most likely makes it easier to understand the material and take notes, but its more expensive, takes up more space and its more difficult to obtain than a digital version.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Paper map vs digital map
                   <ul>
                        <li>- a digital map is easier to use, read, it reads out the directions to you, it notifies you of closures and accidents, but it needs internet connection to use.</li>
                        <li> - a paper map is harder to read, not up to date, and hard to use by yourself.</li>
