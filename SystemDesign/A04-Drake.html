            question1.textContent = "The five key issues for data gathering are goal setting, identifying participants,relationships between data collector and data provider, triangulation and pilot studies.  Setting goals is something we need to show attention to is because setting goals wil shape how the methods to gather data and analyze it will be performed.  Goals can be expressed in many different ways, but usually for data gathering informal goals are more common. identifying participants is the second issue.  There are many different types of sampling and each one is better for different studies.  Different types include random sampling, convenience sampling, snowball sampling and probability vs nonprobability methods.  Third is relationships between the the person doing the gathering and the people providing the data.  How their data is stored and whether it is private or public is one important thing, but another is patient withdrawal from studies.  All of this stems from consent between the patient and gatherer.   Triangulation is the term used for the investigation of phenomenon from different perspectives.  There are four types of triangulation.  of data, investigator, theories and methodological.  All of these triangulation methods are used for how data is gathered, what techniques are used, who do they gather the information from and who gathers the information. Pilot studies is last. Pilot studies is a small trial run of a main study.  This is to make sure the study, the methods used, and other information is viable before starting the main important study. ";

All of these techniques have advantages, disadvantages and are good for certain things.  For me I would use focus groups, indirect observation and direct observation in the field because I feel as though these are the best and most productive methods for me.  Indirect and direct methods would be useful to see how the users change their activity when they know they're being observed and how users act regularly and focus groups to get different viewpoints and ideas about products, issues, and positives.";

They are realistic and describe a broad base of users and goals relating to an under development product.  A scenario is a description of tasks or activities in a story that explains and discusses different requirements and needs.  Doesn't describe use of the software or goals.  They are used to share stakeholders with information from users about certain scenarios.  They are similar because they focus on users and are descriptions about products and requirements used to help designers and stakeholders but they are different because they focus on different specific things and are meant for different groups like stakeholders, designers, user requirements and descriptions.";
