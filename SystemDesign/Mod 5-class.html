        <h2> Chapter 4 and 5 Questions </h2>

        <div id="group1">

            <div id="Q1">
                <h2> Attention </h2>

                <p>
                    Attention is essential to everyday life.  It is the ability to select things on which to concentrate.  
                    It allows us to focus on only information that is related to what were doing.
                    Although this sounds perfect, this process is not simple it can be easy or difficult based on the
                    person in question.

                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li> context! Make the information more important at attentions driven stages of a task </li>
                    <li> avoid cluttering and overuse of information, colors and graphics.  It may be fun to think about, but in excess it becomes distracting </li>
                    <li> Different ways of switching between tabs or interfaces.  Subtle ways or drastic? sounds or lights can help this </li>
                    <li> techniques that can be used to help information attention is animation, color, underlining and ordering of different items </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div id="Q2">
                <h2> Perception </h2>

                <p>

                    Perceptions is information collected from the environment using the five senses.
                    These are then transformed into object, events, sounds and taste experiences.  We can also sense movement of body parts.
                    Perception involves are parts of cognitive processes making it not simple.



                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li> Icons and graphic ideas for products </li>
                    <li> group information together using white space to change users perception on things </li>
                    <li> Difference in audio </li>
                    <li> Color contrast and text to background contrast </li>
                    <li> haptic feedback.  Dont overuse Haptics. Especially feedback </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div id="Q3" >
                <h2> Memory </h2>

                <p>
                    Memory is when you recollect different types of knowledge.
                    This allows people to act differently based on their memories.
                    We cant remember everything because some things are filtered out from our brains memory or encoded.
                    When encoded it makes some things hard to remember based on situations.
                    People are better at recognizing then remembering because were better about picking up details with our naked eye.


                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li> Reducing cognitive load.  Avoid time consuming and complex procedures </li>
                    <li> try to get users to recognize interface designs.  Use familiar ideas and patterns </li>
                    <li> Different ways to download, save and label digital information.  Make sure users can create folders and save files in different ways to make them easily identifiable </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div id="Q4">
                <h2> learning </h2>

                <p>
                    Learning and memory are intertwined. Skills and knowledge work together along with memory to make learning work.
                    Incidental vs intentional learning. accident or intention?
                    Intentional learning is much more difficult to obtain.

                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li> encourage exploration and design </li>
                    <li> Set constraints for new users to guide them to making right choices when learning </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div id="Q5" >
                <h2> Reading, Speaking, and Listening </h2>

                <p>

                    Three forms of language processing that are similar and different.
                    Sentences are the same regardless of what way you receive it however people can speak differently depending on context.
                    permanent vs transient writing.
                    Written is permanent and grammatical.
                    reading is quicker.
                    Listening requires less effort
                    Different applications created to capitalize on peoples strengths in these areas.

                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li> Maximum length menus.  When instructions and menus are too large people get confused or distracted. </li>
                    <li> Make AI voices clearer in order for people to be able to understand them easier </li>
                    <li> Enlarging text, zooming in.  We don't want to affect the format </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div id="Q6" >
                <h2> Problem-Solving, Planning, Reasoning, and Decision-Making </h2>

                <p> 
                    Reflective cognitive processing.
                    Thinking about different actions and their outcomes.
                    You have to be conscious.
                    Different scenarios and different options. Determine which one is the best.
                    Preferences determine these decisions, planning and problem solving.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>  Help pages.  Help users who want to use things more effectively. </li>
                    <li> Use simple and pattern designed functions to help users make faster and better decisions.  Help users set or save their own preferences </li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>
            <button onclick="updateColor()"> Happy Valentines Day! </button> 
        </p>

        <script>
